// Traditionally, Celtic knotwork is drawn on a diagonal grid
// overlaid with straight lines and circles.  We use a simpler
// method devised by Andy Sloss, which divides the knot
// into sections at every other grid point.  Each section can be
// uniquely described by the directions in which the knot passes
// through the section's corners, plus the directions the two lines
// take in the interior of the section.
// There are three possible directions (diagonal, horizontal and
// vertical), so there are 3^5 = 243 basic sections.  The horizontal
// and vertical sections can be split in half for closing up the edges
// of a knot, yielding another 36 shapes.  These are represented
// as a section with two corners that have "no" direction.
//
// Because of symmetries, the 279 different sections can be drawn
// using only 10 basic strokes.
